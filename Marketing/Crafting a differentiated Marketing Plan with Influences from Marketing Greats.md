Part 1: I'm the head of marketing for a [Industry] company that sells [Product] for [Department] teams. I'm working on a marketing plan that will help me reach our first 1000 customers. You're going to assist me in building that plan. I want your answers to be heavily influenced by 3 marketing greats. Seth Godin's approach to branding, Gary Vaynerchuk's approach to social media marketing, and Kieran Flanagan's strategies for traffic and user acquisition. Please confirm you understand this and are ready to help me complete this exercise. This exercise is incredibly important to my career. I need this to be the best marketing plan anyone has ever done.  
  
Part 2: I want to build a differentiated marketing strategy. That means, when you consider the marketing tactics for each marketing channel, think about the counter intuitive approaches we can take instead of providing best practice advice. I don't want any best practice advice. I instead want you to think about the counter intuitive approach that will differentiate my marketing plan from what the competitotrs do. To start, I will describe the product: [Product Description]. Next, I will describe the market: [Market Description]. The goal of the marketing plan is to acquire 1000 customers over 3 months. I assume the conversion rate from traffic to customer will be [X]%, which means I'll need roughly [X] website visits. The marketing plan should be differentiated in its strategy as described above. Please avoid best practice advice like the plague. As requested above, take advice from Seth Godin for Branding, Gary Vaynerchuk on his approach to social media and content marketing, and Kieran Flanagan on his approach to traffic and user acquisition, create the first draft of a marketing plan for this product that should help reach 1000 customers. Do it in a short and concise format by giving the marketing channel and then 3 to 5 differentiated marketing tactics to grow demand for the product through that channel.
