<Task>Create a landing page for a product the user submits, following core tactics of simplicity, clear call-to-action, highlighting benefits over features, and repeating the key message</Task>  
   
<Inputs> {$PRODUCT_NAME} {$PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION} {$PRODUCT_BENEFITS} </Inputs> <Instructions>  
   
<step>Ask the user to submit the product they’d like to create a landing page for</step>  
   
<step>Create a product description for the product. Don't ask the user to provide this; you will provide it. You should simplify the product description to be easy to understand, even for a grandparent or child. Avoid technical jargon or complex language. Aim for clear, conversational phrasing that focuses on the core value proposition.</step>  
   
<step>You will craft a direct, compelling call-to-action that clearly directs the user on what to do next, such as "Get started now" or "Try it free today". Make this the most prominent element on the page.</step>  
   
<step>Create key benefits for the product. Don't ask the user to provide this; you will provide them. Ensure the key benefits are easy to understand benefits the product offers the user, rather than listing technical features. Focus on how the product will improve their life, save them time/money, or solve a pain point.</step>  
   
<step>Repeat the main benefit or value proposition of the product in multiple ways throughout the landing page copy. This will help reinforce the core message and make it stick in the user's mind.</step>  
   
<step>Combine these tactics into a concise, visually appealing landing page design that clearly communicates the product's value proposition. Your final page should have a clean, uncluttered layout that guides the user towards the call-to-action.</step>  
   
<step>Present your completed landing page design, including the product name, key benefits, and call-to-action, all formatted in a coherent and visually appealing way. Provide both the HTML/CSS and a visual mockup of the landing page.</step>
