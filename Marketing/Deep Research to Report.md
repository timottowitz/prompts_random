## **Deep Research Prompt Template Breakdown**

### **1. Context**

**Purpose**: Establish who the requester is, what the company does, and the internal/external environment.  
  

**Includes**:

- Role and department of the user  
      
    
- Company size, industry, and audience  
      
    
- Existing infrastructure (e.g., AI systems, CRMs, tech stacks)  
      
    
- High-level challenges or motivations  
      
    

💡 _Why?_ Provides grounding so the model aligns its response with the business reality and stakeholders.

  
📌 _Example_: “I’m a RevOps leader at a 10,000-person SaaS firm targeting SMB tech buyers. We’ve embedded AI into our CRM and have a strong internal ML team.”

---

### **2. Assignment**

**Purpose**: Define the research task and deliverable.  
**Includes**:

- Nature of the report (structured, strategic, technical, etc.)  
      
    
- Specific research question or topic  
      
    
- Time horizon or planning window (e.g., 12-month roadmap)  
      
    

💡 _Why?_ Clarifies what the model should focus on delivering.  
📌 _Example_: “Research cutting-edge AI tools to support SaaS sales reps in their first discovery call with prospects.”

---

### **3. Objectives & Key Metrics**

**Purpose**: Detail the measurable business goals tied to this research.  
**Includes**:

- Strategic KPIs (e.g., ASP, win rate, pipeline velocity)  
      
    
- Performance indicators relevant to adoption and impact  
      
    

💡 _Why?_ Helps the model prioritize outcomes and recommend tools accordingly.  
📌 _Example_: “Boost Average Selling Price, Win Rate, and Deals Won.”

---

### **4. Scope & Priorities**

**Purpose**: Set boundaries and highlight what’s most important.  
**Includes**:

- What to focus on (e.g., bleeding-edge AI, use-case depth)  
      
    
- What to avoid (e.g., generic chatbots, financial modeling)  
      
    
- Key must-haves (e.g., case studies, implementation plans)  
      
    

💡 _Why?_ Ensures focused, relevant output that avoids filler or overly broad responses.  
📌 _Example_: “Focus on real-time AI tools, provide implementation roadmap and industry case studies.”

---

### **5. Technical Considerations**

**Purpose**: Define the expected technical depth.  
**Includes**:

- Expected modeling approaches (e.g., LLMs, predictive modeling)  
      
    
- Tech stack familiarity (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Workato)  
      
    
- Architecture-level insights and constraints  
      
    

💡 _Why?_ Enables technical teams to get value without oversimplification.  
📌 _Example_: “Include diagrams, NLP frameworks, data pipelines—append deeply technical detail.”

---

### **6. Deliverable Requirements**

**Purpose**: Structure the output for real-world consumption.  
**Includes**:

- Format (report style, use of infographics)  
      
    
- Tone and style (e.g., The Economist)  
      
    
- References and citation guidelines  
      
    
- Clear breakdown into sections or modules  
      
    

💡 _Why?_ Supports both presentation and implementation.  
📌 _Example_: “Use headings, tables, and cite 20+ reputable sources. Write in a clear, strategic tone.”

---

### **7. Suggested Outline**

**Purpose**: Guide the structure of the output.  
**Includes**:

- Recommended sections (e.g., Executive Summary, Roadmap)  
      
    
- Pages per section  
      
    
- Inclusion of appendices for depth  
      
    

💡 _Why?_ Gives the model a clear scaffold to follow.  
📌 _Example_: “Structure around key stages—emerging tech, roadmap, architecture, vendors.”

---

### **8. Special Instructions**

**Purpose**: Address style, formatting, or practical instructions.  
**Includes**:

- No multi-part disclaimers  
      
    
- Acceptable use of hypothetical citations  
      
    
- Visual placeholder expectations  
      
    

💡 _Why?_ Prevents deviation from expected document standards.  
📌_Example_: “If sources don’t exist, create hypothetical but plausible citations and mark clearly.”
