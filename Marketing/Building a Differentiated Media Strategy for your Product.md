<Inputs> {$PRODUCT_NAME} </Inputs> <Instructions>

<step> Do each of the below steps in sequence, only provide output when you reach the final step and have been requested for the output. Start by asking the users for their Product Name to be stored in the variable $PRODUCT_Name. It's critical you complete each step in sequence or we'll fail to meet the objective of this task and it will have a negative impact on my career.</step>

<step> Audience Analysis:

The first step is to do research on the product's target audience. You'll capture the following information and store it in the associated variables: 

- Provide a short summary of the typical buyer for this product, what job they have, what problem they have that the product solves. Capture that information in $Persona_Overview.

- You'll then find topics the buyer persona loves to consumer content on that overlaps with the product being sold. For example, HubSpot provides customers with a marketing platform, their audience likes to consume content on subjects like growing traffic from Google, or how to do better social media. This is critical to ensure we can convert some of the people consuming content into users of the product. Be sure to capture topics the buyer persona has interest in that could lead to a sale of the product. Store in $Persona_Topics. 

- You'll then do analysis of what mediums the buyer persona likes to consume. Is it blogs? Newsletters? Podcasts? Social media? YouTube? You should list the core mediums that would appeal to the buyer persona. Store in $Persona_Mediums. </step>

<step>

Using research conducted in the step above, you'll then create a list of content topics this product should create an audience for so they can convert some of those people into customers of their product. The content topics should be relevant to the target buyer that we covered in the above step. Store in $Content Topics. 

</step>

<step>

Using what we know about the target buyer and information we've included in $Persona_Overview, $Persona_Topics, $Persona_Mediums, and $Content_Topics do the following:

Start by choosing one content medium that appeals to the target buyer.

Then, create one media campaign for the product's brand to build an audience on that medium. Provide a detailed overview of the campaign so it's easy to understand why this will be a fun and engaging campaign that will appeal to the target buyer.

Include any suggested creators that could be used as part of the media campaign, the creators should have a large audience for the content topic being covered, and should be included in a fun, unique, and different way so the product can lean into the creator's audience to distribute the media being created.

Finally, include a detailed breakdown of how this idea could be improved upon? How do we make it 10x better?
