### Phase 1: Concept Mastery

###### Tasks

1. Summarize Epstein's definitions of **kind** and **wicked** learning environments in ≤ 200 words each.
2. Identify at least **three diagnostic criteria** that reliably distinguish kind from wicked problems (e.g., feedback speed, rule clarity, repeatability).
3. Provide **two classic examples** of each problem type _outside_ the GTM world (sports, medicine, chess, entrepreneurship, etc.) to anchor the concept.
4. Cite primary sources: _Range_, relevant academic papers Epstein references, plus any updated literature post-2019 that refines or challenges the model.

###### Output Format

- Bulleted definitions
- Table of diagnostic criteria (columns: Criterion | Kind Score | Wicked Score | Explanation)
- Short example blurbs (≈75 words each)
- Reference list (APA or MLA)

### Phase 2: GTM Analysis & Charting

###### Scope

Evaluate the following GTM layers (feel free to add others you deem essential):

- **Marketing:** demand gen, brand building, SEO/Content, paid acquisition, product marketing, community, lifecycle/retention.
- **Sales:** SDR/BDR prospecting, discovery & demo, negotiation, forecasting, pipeline management.
- **Customer Success:** onboarding, adoption coaching, renewals, expansion, support ticket deflection, health-score analytics.

###### Tasks

1. For each layer, list 5–10 high-impact **strategies or tactics** currently used by leading SaaS or tech companies.
2. Classify each tactic as **Kind**, **Wicked**, or **Hybrid**.
    - If Hybrid, briefly note which elements are kind-like vs. wicked-like.
3. **Justify** every classification in 1–2 sentences, tying back to the diagnostic criteria from Phase 1.
4. Recommend one **management approach** (e.g., playbooks, experimentation cadence, skill development) best suited to each category and explain why.

###### Output Format

Produce a **matrix** with the following columns:

|GTM Function|Strategy/Tactic|Kind / Wicked / Hybrid|Key Diagnostic Signals|Recommended Management Approach|
|---|---|---|---|---|

Follow the matrix with a concise narrative (≤ 500 words) highlighting:

- Patterns you observe (e.g., "data-heavy, algorithmic tactics skew kind" vs. "trust-building interactions skew wicked").
- Implications for org design, KPI selection, and talent development.

###### Style & Depth Guidelines

- Aim for MBA-level rigor and clear, practitioner-friendly language.
- Use sub-headings and bullets for readability; avoid fluff.
- Where data exists (benchmarks, case studies), reference it—but flag gaps openly.
- Limit Phase 1 to ~700 words and Phase 2 to ~1,500 words (flex ±15% if needed).

###### Citation & Verification

- Inline-cite facts or external data.
- At the end, append a reference list of all works cited.
